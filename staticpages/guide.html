        <h2>Assumptions</h2>
        We assume that you have a Raspberry Pi that you would like to use as an
        EPICS IOC to control/monitor a system via a serial port.
        For the moment, this port is set when creating the empty IOC (defaulting to
        <span class="code">/dev/ttyUSB0</span>).  To alter the serial port manually, edit the file
        <span class="code">/home/pi/Apps/epics/iceCubeIOC/iocBoot/iociceCubeIOC/st.cmd</span>
        and alter the reference to <span class="code">/dev/ttyUSB0</span>.
        <br>
        The control functionality offered by this architecture is, from the point
        of view of the EPICS IOC, a state-machine.  That is, the IOC will send
        serial commands to the controlled-system (e.g., the Arduino) to change its
        state, or to request the values of various settings.  The detailed
        behaviour of the system is expected to be coded into the system itself; e.g.,
        via code uploaded to the Arduino microcontroller (perhaps modelled on the
        skeleton code produced by this app).
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Installing EPICS</h2>
        For any of this to work, you will need EPICS installed on your Raspberry Pi.
        This can be done by following the instructions given by Steve Molloy at
        <a id="normallink" target="_blank" href="http://www.smolloy.com/2015/12/epics-ioc-on-a-raspberry-pi/">this link</a>,
        but executing <a id="normallink" href="https://github.com/se-esss-litterbox/EPICSpi/archive/master.zip">this script</a>
        (from the front page) will do the hard-work for you.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Building an IceCube</h2>
        Start by making an empty IceCube IOC.  A script to do this for you is on the
        <a id="normallink" href="..">home page</a> of this app, or you can just
        <a id="normallink" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/se-esss-litterbox/EPICSpi/master/makeEmptyIceCube.sh">click here</a>.  Download
        that file, and execute it in the folder you would like the IOC to be installed.  We recommend
        putting it in <span class="code">/home/pi/Apps/epics/</span>.  The script
        accepts a flag, <span class="code">-pPORT</span>, where <span class="code">PORT</span>
        should be replaced with the serial port that the Arduino is connected to.  This will
        default to <span class="code">/dev/ttyUSB0</span> if the flag is omitted.<br>
        There are two files missing from the IceCube IOC that you just made,
        and the lack of these will mean that an attempt to compile it will
        fail.  You need to add the following files:
        <ul>
          <li><span class="code">arduino.proto</span> defines the communications
            protocol.</li>
          <li><span class="code">arduino.db</span> specifies process variables
            that will be served by the IOC.</li>
        </ul>
        These files are contructed by filling out the necessary values on the forms
        on the <a id="normallink">main page</a> of the app.  As you do this, you
        will notice that the code blocks at the bottom of the page will be populated
        according to the values you have provided.  These blocks contain the necessary
        contents of the two missing files.
        <br>
        Click the link to download the "Protocol File", and save this into
        <span class="code">/home/pi/Apps/epics/iceCubeIOC/iceCubeIOCApp/Db/arduino.proto</span>.
        Then click on the "EPICS DB File" link, and save this into
        <span class="code">/home/pi/Apps/epics/iceCubeIOC/iceCubeIOCApp/Db/arduino.db</span>.
        Note that the naming and location of these files (with respect to
        <span class="code">/home/pi/Apps/epics/iceCubeIOC/</span>) is critical.
        <br>
        Once that has been done, navigate to <span class="code">/home/pi/Apps/epics/iceCubeIOC</span>
        and run <span class="code">make</span>.  If this is successful, you are now
        able to run the IOC.
        <br>
        <span class="code">./bin/linux-arm/iceCubeIOC iocBoot/iociceCubeIOC/st.cmd</span>
        <br>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Using the Arduino skeleton file</h2>
        If you want to control an Arduino-based system with this, then you
        need to make sure the Arduino is set up so as to properly react to the
        serial commands sent by the IOC.  There are many ways to do that, but one
        way would be to use the suggested skeleton file.
        <br>
        Download this, open it in the Arduino IDE, add the appropriate code, and
        upload to the Arduino.  This should provide you with a fully functional
        EPICS-controlled Arduino.
