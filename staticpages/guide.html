        <h2>Assumptions</h2>
        We assume that you have a Raspberry Pi that you would like to use as an
        EPICS IOC to control/monitor a system via a serial port.
        For the moment, this port is hard-coded as being <span class="code">/dev/ttyACM0</span>,
        since this is the standard for Arduino systems, however future updates will
        allow flexibility in this.  To alter the serial port manually, edit the file
        <span class="code">/home/pi/Apps/epics/iceCubeIOC/iocBoot/iociceCubeIOC/st.cmd</span>
        and alter the reference to <span class="code">/dev/ttyACM0</span>.
        <br>
        The control functionality offered by this architecture is, from the point
        of view of the EPICS IOC, a state-machine.  That is, the IOC will send
        serial commands to the controlled-system (e.g., the Arduino) to change its
        state, or to request the values of various settings.  The detailed
        behaviour of the system is expected to be coded into the system itself; e.g.,
        via code uploaded to the Arduino microcontroller (perhaps modelled on the
        skeleton code produced by this app).
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Installing EPICS</h2>
        For any of this to work, you will need EPICS installed on your Raspberry Pi.
        This should be done by following the instructions given by Steve Molloy at
        <a id="normallink" target="_blank" href="http://www.smolloy.com/2015/12/epics-ioc-on-a-raspberry-pi/">this link</a>.
        Future work will provide functionality to do all of this work for you.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Building an IceCube</h2>
        Start by downloading the empty IceCube IOC.  The link to this is on the
        <a id="normallink" href="..">home page</a> of this app, or you can just
        <a id="normallink" href="/files/iceCubeIOC.tar.gz">click here</a>.  Download
        that file, and unzip/untar it into some appropriate place.  We recommend
        putting it in <span class="code">/home/pi/Apps/epics/</span>.
        <br>
        <span class="code">tar zxvf iceCubeIOC.tar.gz -C /home/pi/Apps/epics/</span>
        <br>
        There are two files missing from the IceCube IOC that you just downloaded,
        and the lack of these will mean that an attempt to compile it will
        fail.  You need to make two files:
        <ul>
          <li><span class="code">arduino.proto</span> defines the communications
            protocol.</li>
          <li><span class="code">arduino.db</span> specifies process variables
            that will be served by the IOC.</li>
        </ul>
        These files are contructed by filling out the necessary values on the forms
        on the <a id="normallink">main page</a> of the app.  As you do this, you
        will notice that the code blocks at the bottom of the page will be populated
        according to the values you have provided.  These blocks contain the necessary
        contents of the two missing files.
        <br>
        Copy the code listed under "Protocol File" into a new file called
        <span class="code">/home/pi/Apps/epics/iceCubeIOC/iceCubeIOCApp/Db/arduino.proto</span>,
        and  the code listed under "EPICS DB File" into a new file called
        <span class="code">/home/pi/Apps/epics/iceCubeIOC/iceCubeIOCApp/Db/arduino.db</span>.
        Note that the naming and location of these files (with respect to
        <span class="code">/home/pi/Apps/epics/iceCubeIOC/</span>) is critical.
        <br>
        Once that has been done, navigate to <span class="code">/home/pi/Apps/epics/iceCubeIOC</span>
        and run <span class="code">make</span>.  If this is successful, you are now
        able to run the IOC.
        <br>
        <span class="code">./bin/linux-arm/iceCubeIOC iocBoot/iociceCubeIOC/st.cmd</span>
        <br>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Using the Arduino skeleton file</h2>
        If you want to control an Arduino-based system with this, then you
        need to make sure the Arduino is set up so as to properly react to the
        serial commands sent by the IOC.  There are many ways to do that, but one
        way would be to use the suggested skeleton file.
        <br>
        Copy and paste it into the Arduino IDE, add the appropriate code, and
        upload to the Arduino.  This should provide you with a fully functional
        EPICS-controlled Arduino.
